# Portfolio 1: Spread of Noise
This piece attempts to capture visually how rumors spread on the internet. It looks similar to how cells propagate, or bubbles grow and disappear. 

# Portfolio 2: Relatable Smoke
The shape of smoke implies the correlation between personal relationships and the truth of a rumor. 

# Portfolio 3: Rumor Data Visualization
Like any teenager, I am addicted to social networking sites. One thing I notice about them is some rumors disappear as fast as they have spread there. I have attempted to capture this intriguing phenomenon numerically. 

# Portfolio 4: Languages
I can speak three languages: Korean, English and Chinese. In different languages, some of two completely different words can sound similar. This self-observation inspired the current piece - the outcome of an overlay of disparate processes - which employs the words I blend most liberally in daily conversation.
